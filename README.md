# Three-in-One Game Suite

## Overview

The **Three-in-One Game Suite** is a Java application project developed entirely by me. It allows users to play three distinct games from a single launcher:

- **Advanced Sudoku Solver**: Solve and visualize Sudoku puzzles.
- **Tower of Hanoi Visualization**: Interactive and animated Tower of Hanoi puzzle.
- **Tic Tac Toe**: A classic Tic Tac Toe game with visual feedback.

The application features a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) and utilizes recursion and backtracking algorithms in the backend to power the games.

## Features

- **Central Launcher**: Easily access and launch any of the three games from a single interface.
- **Stylish GUI**: A modern and responsive interface with 3D buttons for each game.
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Utilizes recursion and backtracking for game logic.
